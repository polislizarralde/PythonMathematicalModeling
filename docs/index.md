# Welcome to my Python playground for Mathematical Modeling

Hola! I'm a Diana Lizarralde, a researcher at the **Centre for Ecological and
Evolutionary Synthesis (CEES)** at the **University of Oslo (UiO)**, working on
the _Nordemics project_. This website is dedicated to exploring various
mathematical modeling projects using Python.

## Featured Project: The Plague in Scania

In this project, we delve into the mysteries surrounding the Plague in Scania by
using advanced mathematical models and Python programming. Our aim is to uncover
hidden patterns, trends, and facts that have remained unknown until now. Stay
tuned for updates and findings from this exciting research!

Feel free to browse through my website to learn more about these fascinating
projects. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, don't hesitate
to reach out or open a pull request. Happy exploring!
